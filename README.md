# 🚗 Global EV Sales Analysis (2010–2024) | Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **global Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends from 2010 to 2024** using Power BI.  
The objective is to provide **data-driven insights** into EV sales, stock growth, powertrain adoption, regional performance, charging infrastructure expansion, and energy demand to support **business, policy, and strategic decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze global EV adoption trends over time (2010–2024)
- Identify regional differences in EV sales and stock
- Analyze EV growth across vehicle categories and transport modes
- Compare powertrain adoption trends (BEV, PHEV, FCEV)
- Evaluate key EV-related parameters such as charging infrastructure and electricity demand
- Perform time-series and comparative analysis
- Provide actionable insights for strategic planning

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** IEA Global EV Data  
- **Time Period:** 2010–2024  
- **Data Type:** Historical data (projection scenarios filtered out)

### Key Columns
- `region` – Country or geographic region  
- `category` – Historical or projection scenario  
- `parameter` – EV metric (stock, sales, charging points, energy demand, etc.)  
- `mode` – Vehicle type (Cars, Buses, Vans, Trucks)  
- `powertrain` – EV technology (BEV, PHEV, FCEV, charging types)  
- `year` – Calendar year  
- `unit` – Measurement unit  
- `value` – Numeric measurement of the parameter  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed aggregated regions such as **World** and **Rest of World** to avoid double-counting
- Filtered dataset strictly to **2010–2024**
- Created a `transport_type` column (Passenger vs Freight)
- Created a `development_status` column (Developed vs Developing countries)
- Handled multiple units and parameter-specific aggregations carefully
